GOAL: I want to completely redesign the DescriptorSet API to use a more BindGroup - like API.

STRUCTURES:
- BindGroup
- BindGroupLayout

SAMPLE API USAGE:

let layout = foo.create_bind_group_layout(BindGroupLayoutDesc{
    buffers: Vec<BindGroupBufferDesc>,
    images: Vec<BindGroupImageDesc>,
});

let bind_group = foo.create_bind_group(BindGroupDesc{
    layout: BindGroupLayout,
    buffers Vec<Buffer>,
    images: Vec<Image>
});

Later use handles to these resources in shaders, etc
